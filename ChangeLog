	* Makefile.pm (expand_text): Support the --norc_substitution
	option so we can handle those weird makefiles that need trailing
	space on variables.

	* TextSubs.pm (split_on_colon): don't look for colons after a
	semicolon.  This solves a bug with a rule that looks like this:
	    $(srcdir)/cat-id-tbl.c: stamp-cat-id; @:

Version 1.03 released.

	* MakeEvent.pm: simply increment a value in the signal handler,
	rather than pushing something onto an array.  This seems to fix
	the erratic perl core dumps that we were having.
	
	* Makefile.pm (parse_rule): use filesubst instead of patsubst for
	pattern rules, so we handle directory aliases properly.
	
	* Makesubs.pm (f_filesubst): new function to handle directory
	names like "./src" which were making patsubst fail when used with 
	GNU make style pattern rules.

	* Makefile.pm (parse_rule): Attempt to fix problems with indented
	rules using a much more complicated heuristic.

	* Makesubs.pm (scanner_c_compilation): fixed bug where indented
	#includes were not found.

	* Glob.pm (find_real_subdirs): avoid usage of undefined value
	warning if the directory doesn't exist.

	* Rule.pm (find_all_targets_dependencies): return the explicitly
	targets and dependencies in the order they were specified, so they
	are built in a predictable order.  Previously, they were returned
	in a random order.
