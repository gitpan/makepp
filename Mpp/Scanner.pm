=head1 NAME

Mpp::Scanner - Base class for makepp file scanners

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mpp::Scanner;
  our @ISA = qw/Mpp::Scanner/;
  sub xscan_file {
    my $self=shift;
    my ($cp, $tag, $finfo, $conditional, $fh)=@_;
    while(<$fh>) {
      # ...
    }
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Mpp::Scanner> is a base class for makepp(1) file scanners.
It supports both conditional scanning and unconditional scanning.

The scanner for a particular language should derive from this class.
An object of this type is normally instantiated by an object of type
C<Mpp::CommandParser>.

If unconditional scanning is used, then every include statement is considered
active.
This has the advantage that scanning is simpler, and that include directives
are easily cached.
However, it has the disadvantage of possibly creating incorrect dependencies.
For example, in C the following lines should not affect the dependencies:

  #if 0
  # include "foo.h"
  #endif

Also, the following should imply a dependency on foo.h, which should itself
be scanned:

  #define NAME "foo.h"
  #include NAME

The reason that the include directives cannot easily be cached in conditional
scanning is that the same file might include different things depending on
what preceded it and what was defined on the command line.
For the same reason, it is not possible to scan include files for the same
translation in parallel if conditional scanning is employed (although that
isn't done with unconditional scanning either right now).

# probably infinite recursion anyway, so we're very unlikely to miss

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $scanner = Mpp::Scanner->new($rule, $dir, $conditional);

Returns a new Mpp::Scanner for rule $rule.
$dir is the directory name (relative to the CWD of $rule's Makefile) in which
files are to be interpretted.
$conditional is TRUE if conditional scanning is to be used, FALSE if not,
and undef if it is to be determined from the rule options.
The subclass may override this method, and may have different parameters.

  }, $class;
}

=head2 add_include_dir

  $scanner->add_include_dir($tag, $path);

Add directory $path (relative to $self->{DIR}) to the include path for tag
$tag.
Tags can be anything you want, as long as they are lowercase, for example
"user" and "sys" for the C double-quote include path and angle-bracket include
path, respectively.

An undefined $path represents the directory in which
the file containing the include directive resides.

      # an include file is picked up changes due to a
      # retargeted symbolic link, then a re-scan gets forced
      # (once the retargeting detection logic is added).

	' mentioned in command `' . $self->{RULE}->source . "'\n"
        unless $dir_warnings{absolute_filename( $dirinfo )}++;
				# Don't give the same warning more than

    );
  }
}

=head2 add_include_suffix

  $scanner->add_include_suffix($tag, $suffix);

Append $suffix to the list of suffixes to append to the string
naming the file to be included (I<i.e.> the $name parameter of the include()
method).
The list starts as an empty array, but it defaults to C<("")> if a file is
sought before any suffix is added.
Directory search order takes precedence over suffix search order.
[This is used by VCS, as well as a number of other Verilog-related tools.]

=cut

my %suffix_list_cache;
sub add_include_suffix {
  my( $self, $tag, $sfx ) = @_;
  my @sfxs = @{$self->{$tag}[INCLUDE_SFXS] || []};
  push(@sfxs, $sfx);
  $self->add_include_suffix_list($tag, \@sfxs);
}
sub add_include_suffix_list {
  my( $self, $tag, $sfxs ) = @_;
  $sfxs = $suffix_list_cache{"@$sfxs"} ||= $sfxs;
  $self->{$tag}[INCLUDE_SFXS] = $sfxs;
  $self->{RULE}->add_include_suffix_list( $self->get_tagname($tag), $sfxs );
}

=head2 should_find

  $scanner->should_find($tag);

Add include path tag $tag to the list of tags that should generate a warning
if the requested file is not found.
I<Not> calling this is useful, for example, for C angle-bracket includes,
wherein it is likely that the file won't be found because we don't know the
entire standard system include path.
It is assumed that files included from the system include path would I<not>
be included with double quotes, to avoid false warnings.

=cut

sub should_find {
  $_[0]{$_[1]}[SHOULD_FIND] = 1;
}

=head2 info_string

  $scanner->info_string( $hashref );

Sets the build_info_string name associated with includes using the $tag
include path to $name.
For example, in C, "user" maps to "INCLUDES" and "sys" maps to
"SYSTEM_INCLUDES".

B<NOTE:> If you assign an info_string to any tag, then you need to assign
info_string's to all the tags, or else the tags that aren't assigned will be
ignored when the cached includes are used.

=cut

sub info_string {
  $_[0]{INFO_STRING} = $_[1];
}

=head2 dont_scan

  $scanner->dont_scan($finfo, $absname);

Returns 1 if the file $finfo should be scanned.
$absname, if defined, must be $finfo's absolute filename.

Files that shouldn't be scanned typically include the system include files,
as well as any files that are in a directory that can't be written by the
current user.
It is assumed that such files don't include other files that change between
clean builds.
This makes scanning go faster, and reduces the amount of "noise" emitted by
makepp.

=cut

sub dont_scan {
  my ($self, $finfo, $absname) = @_;
  unless( Mpp::File::is_writable( $finfo->{'..'} )) {
    Mpp::log SCAN_NOT_UNWRITABLE => $finfo
      if $Mpp::log_level;
    return 1;
  }
  $absname ||= absolute_filename( $finfo->{'..'} );
  if( $absname =~ m@^/usr/(?:X11(?:R.)?/|local/)include\b@ ) {
				# Don't scan stuff in the system directories.
				# This can lead to problems if we build as
				# a user and then install as root.  This won't
				# completely solve the problem, but it will
				# make it much less common.
    Mpp::log SCAN_NOT_SYS => $finfo
      if $Mpp::log_level;
    return 1;
  }
  0;
}

=head2 scan_file

  $scanner->scan_file($command_parser, $tag, $name);

Check for cached dependencies of the file given by $name (relative to the
current directory).
If they are found, then add them to the dependency list, and either scan them
recursively, or add them to the list of dependencies to scan later.
Otherwise, delegate to $self->xscan_file().

Before this method returns sucessfully, all of the files that are included
(possibly recursively) by the file will have been scanned.

The return value is TRUE on success, FALSE if any files to be scanned failed
to build, or if scanning failed.

}

=head2 continue_scanning

  $scanner->continue_scanning($command_parser);

Scan pending files.
This is useful if include() is called after the last scan_file() call.
Returns TRUE if and only if any files were scanned.
Returns undef if and only if a file to be scanned failed to build, or if
scanning failed.

    ) or return undef;
  }
  $result;
}

=head2 xscan_file

  $scanner->xscan_file($command_parser, $tag, $finfo, $conditional, $fh);

The derived class should define this to scan file handle $fh
and report implicit dependencies by calling the include method.

If $conditional is FALSE, then the following methods may not be called:

  push_scope
  pop_scope

Also, is_active() is guaranteed to return TRUE, and include() is guaranteed
not to call scan_file() recursively.

$fh is a file handle that is intially opened for reading at the beginning of
the file to be scanned.

This method should be called only from scan_file() and not directly, because
otherwise you have to check for cached includes yourself.  Implemented by
classes which inherit from this.

A FALSE return value is interpreted as a scanning failure.

=cut

=head2 find

  $scanner->find($tag, $name, $src_dir);

Returns the Mpp::File object associated with

$tag is the include path tag, and $src is the source Mpp::File,
if any, or the source directory Mpp::File.

=head2 include

  $scanner->include($command_parser, $tag, $name, $src);

Signals that an include file whose name is $name and whose type is $tag
was requested, but only if $self->{ACTIVE} is TRUE.
If the file is found, then a dependency is added to $self->rule and the
Mpp::File object of the file is returned.
Otherwise, 1 is returned if the file is not found, or undef is returned if
there was an error generating it or some other nested include file.

Whether this returns immediately or calls $self->xscan_file() recursively
is not guaranteed.
Currently, it is if and only if $self->{CONDITIONAL} is TRUE.

Whether this sets the build_info_string INCLUDE's of $name is not
guaranteed.
Currently, it does if and only if $self->{CONDITIONAL} is FALSE.

=head2 rule

  my $rule=$scanner->rule;

  my $dir=$scanner->dir;

Returns the dir name.

=cut

sub dir { $_[0]{DIR} }

=head2 get_file_info

=head2 get_context

  my $context=$scanner->get_context;

Returns a scalar representing the current scanning context, I<i.e.> the
variable settings and enclosing scopes.
The format of this scalar is not guaranteed, but you can pass it to reset().

=cut

sub get_context {
  my %vars=%{$_[0]{VARS}};

  [\%vars, \@scopes, $_[0]{DEPTH}];
}

=head2 reset

  $scanner->reset;
  $scanner->reset($context);

Denotes the beginning of a new translation unit.
Reset all variables, and sets $self->{ACTIVE} to TRUE.
A C<Mpp::Scanner> object is guaranteed to be in the reset state on return
from new().
If $context (from get_context()) is specified, then reset to that context
instead of clearing everything.

Returns the value of the variable whose name is $name.

=cut

sub get_var { $_[0]{VARS}{$_[1]} }

=head2 push_scope

  $scanner->push_scope($act);

Push a new scope, and set $self->{ACTIVE} to $act if $self->{ACTIVE} is TRUE.
A scope is typically introduced when a preprocessor conditional
(I<e.g.> C<#ifdef>) is encountered, and the scope is inactive if its
conditional evaluated false.

=cut

sub push_scope {
  $_[0]{ACTIVE} &&= $_[1];
  push(@{$_[0]{SCOPES}}, $_[0]{ACTIVE});
}

=head2 pop_scope

  $scanner->pop_scope;

Reverse the most recent push_scope().
A scope is typically closed when a preprocessor conditional
is terminated (I<e.g.> with C<#endif>).
Returns $self->{ACTIVE} before popping.

=cut

=head1 FUTURE WORK

One way to cache the scanning of include files with conditional scanning in
force is to generate a rendition of the source file that has only the
preprocessor directives in it, and scan that instead.
That file can be kept up-to-date using makepp in the usual way (more or less).
Then the amount of I/O required for scanning is then much less when the source
file hasn't been modified.
