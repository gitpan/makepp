Makeppclean efficiently removes files that were knowingly generated through
makepp.  For each I<path>, if I<path> is not a directory and was known to be
generated by makepp by virtue of having a build info file with a matching
signature, then remove I<path> and its build info file; and if I<path> is a
directory, do the same for every file in I<path>, and then remove the build
info directory below I<path>.  I<path> defaults to ".".

The traditional approach to removing generated files is to create a C<clean>
target in your makefiles whose action is to remove all of the targets.
This approach has some fundamental limitations:

=over 2

=item *

It requires that all the relevant makefiles be loaded before cleaning. This
can take quite a while.

=item *

If the clean target in one makefile depends on the clean target in another
makefile, then it is possible that a file that must be built in order to
load one of the makefiles (e.g. because of a prebuild statement) has already
been built and cleaned by the time it needs to be built again.  Makepp wisely
fails in this situation, rather than potentially building the same file many
times during the course of a single build.

Provided that your intention is to remove all the generated files without
regard for which makefile (if any) currently generates them, then these
limitations are avoided by using makeppclean.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -A I<filename>

=item --args-file=I<filename>

=item --arguments-file=I<filename>

Read the file and parse it as possibly quoted whitespace- and/or newline-separated options.

=item -b

=item --build-cache-links

=item --only-build-cache-links

Remove only links or files from a build cache.

=item -?

=item -h

=item --help

Print out a brief summary of the options.

=item -l

=item --leave-src-info

Leave the build info directory below each named directory.

=item -R

=item --repository-links

=item --only-repository-links

Remove only links pointing to a repository.

=item -r

=item --recurse

=item --recursive

Descend each named directory recursively.  Symbolic links are not followed.

=item -v

=item --verbose

Enable verbose output to STDERR.

=item -V

=item --version

Print out the version number.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

Makeppclean looks at the following environment variable:

=over 4

=item $MAKEPPCLEANFLAGS

Any flags in this environment variable are interpreted as command line options
before any explicit options.  Quotes are interpreted like in makefiles.
