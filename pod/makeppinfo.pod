B<makeppinfo> I<option> file ...

B<mppi> I<option> file ...

Makepp writes detailed information about the files it built and about their
dependencies.  This information is stored in the F<.makepp> subdirectory along
the file it pertains to.  It has the form of key-value pairs.  In some cases
the value will again be a list of associated pairs, typically the signature
and the file.

These signature lists are the most frequent reason for rebuilding a file, so
you might like to check, whether the signature stored for a dependency matches
the current build_signature of that file.

This command is partially a makepp debug tool.  To understand the full output,
you may need to look at the source code.  That said, there is also some
generally interesting information to be gotten.

Valid options are:

=over

=item -A I<filename>

=item --args-file=I<filename>

=item --arguments-file=I<filename>

Read the file and parse it as possibly quoted whitespace- and/or newline-separated options.

=item -f

=item --force

Display info even when it is invalid because of inexistent or modified file.

=item -?

=item -h

=item --help

Print out a brief summary of the options.

=item -k I<list>

=item --keys=I<list>

=item --keylist=I<list>

The I<list> specifies one or more space separated Shell style patterns (with
[xyz], ?, *, {a,bc,def}).  Remember to protect these from your Shell by
quoting.  These are matched against the keys.  Each pattern may be preceded
with an exclamtion mark (C<!>) or a caret (C<^>) to exclude the matched keys
from those selected before instead of adding them to the selection.  If the
first pattern starts with an exclamtion mark, it operates on all keys.

    --keys='COMMAND CWD'	# How was this built and where (relative to file).

=item -q

=item --quiet

Don't list file and key names.  Repeat to also omit warnings.

=item -t

=item --traverse

Also output the same information for each file in SORTED_DEPS (recursively if
repeated).

=item -V

=item --version

Print out the version number.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

Makeppinfo looks at the following environment variable:

=over 4

=item $MAKEPPINFOFLAGS

Any flags in this environment variable are interpreted as command line options
before any explicit options.  Quotes are interpreted like in makefiles.
