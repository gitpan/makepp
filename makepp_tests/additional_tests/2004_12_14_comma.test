# This test is sort of bogus, because it verifies that wildcards *don't*
# match filenames containing comma, because they currently get interpretted
# as argument separators.  Once this is no longer the case, this test should
# be modified to verify that matches can be used in function calls without
# separating arguments.

# Cygwin lowercases and thus wildcard sorts differently
