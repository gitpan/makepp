    <h1>Unexpected Features and Limitations</h1>

    <h2>Known bugs</h2>

    <p>As soon as I find these bugs, I'll fix them. :-)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Occasionally perl (5.005 and 5.6.0) dumps core when running
      <i>makepp</i>.  This is a perl bug, not a <i>makepp</i> bug, since
      no pure perl script should ever dump core.  At this point I don't
      know what's causing it.  Just rerun <i>makepp</i> and it will pick
      up where it left off.

      <li>There are a few occasional bugs that crop up when you are
      building makefiles that invoke make recursively.  Occasionally
      <i>makepp</i> simply hangs.  The best workaround for this problem
      is to get rid of recursive make invocations in your makefiles.
      The next best workaround is simply to stop <i>makepp</i> and rerun
      it, and it will pick up where it left off.
    </ul>

    <p>You may also want to look through the section on <a
    href="incompat.html">incompatibilities</a> for more unexpected
    features.  If you find a bug or an undesirable feature, please feel
    free to send <a href="mailto:holt@lnc.usc.edu">me</a> a note.</p>

    <p><i>Makepp</i> also has a few quirks that might be a bit surprising.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<i>Makepp</i>'s implementation of repositories has
	some limitations that might not be obvious.  See the
	<a href="repositories.html#caveats">discussion about
	  repositories</a> for more details.

      <li>
	<i>Makepp</i>'s <code>**</code> wildcard won't see directories
	that begin with a period (e.g., <code>.libs</code>).  This is
	normally what you want, but might be occasionally surprising.

      <li>
	<p><i>makepp</i>'s automatic dependency scanner does not know
	about preprocessor conditionals.  Thus if you do something like
	this:
<pre>
#ifdef VAR
#include "file1.h"
#else
#include "file2.h"
#endif
</pre>
	<p><i>makepp</i> will assume both <code>file1.h</code> and
	<code>file2.h</code> are dependencies.  This will usually not be
	a problem--it will just trigger rebuilds more often than
	necessary--unless one of the files doesn't exist.  In this case,
	<i>makepp</i> will give a warning message (but will still
	compile as usual).  If, however, you use the system include
	format, i.e.,
<pre>
#include &lt;xyz.h&gt;
</pre>
	instead of
<pre>
#include "xyz.h"
</pre>
	then <i>makepp</i> won't complain about a missing file because
	it assumes it's buried in some system include directory that it
	doesn't know about.</p>

      <li>
	<i>Makepp</i> does not like it if you create new soft links to
	existing directories during the course of the build.  It
	shouldn't get confused if you create new directories, just don't
	create new soft links to existing directories.

      <li>
	<i>Makepp</i> is slower than make.  This is mostly because it's
	doing a lot more work.  You can speed it up somewhat by <a
	href="command_line.html#option_nolog">turning off logging</a>,
	but because it is doing a lot more comparisons, it will always
	be slower.

      <li>
	<i>Makepp</i> can use a surprisingly large amount of memory.
	This is (a) because it's written in perl, and perl is a memory
	hog; (b) because of <i>makepp</i>'s algorithm, it simply has to
	store a lot more information about many more files than make
	does.  But if someone wants to pay to have the core of it
	rewritten in C++, then it could be somewhat faster and a lot
	smaller....
    </ul>
