    <h1>Unexpected Features and Limitations</h1>

    <h2>Known bugs</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Makepp</i> occasionally trips a bug in perl that causes a
	core dump.  I don't know why this happens, or what causes it,
	but you can always run <i>makepp</i> again with the same
	arguments, and it will get past the point where it crashed
	before.
    </ul>

    <p>None currently.</p>

    <p>You may want to look through the section on <a
    href="incompat.html">incompatibilities</a> for unexpected features.
    If you find a bug or an undesirable feature, please feel free to
    send <a href="mailto:holt@lnc.usc.edu">me</a> a note.</p>

    <p><i>Makepp</i> also has a few quirks that might be a bit surprising.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Makepp</i> at present does not have any builtin rules.
	This meant that it doesn't know how to compile anything unless
	you provide a pattern rule for it.  This may change in future
	releases.

      <li>
	<i>Makepp</i>'s implementation of repositories has
	some limitations that might not be obvious.  See the
	<a href="repositories.html#caveats">discussion about
	  repositories</a> for more details.

      <li>
	<i>Makepp</i>'s <code>**</code> wildcard won't see directories
	that begin with a period (e.g., <code>.libs</code>).  This is
	normally what you want, but might be occasionally surprising.

      <li>
	<p><i>makepp</i>'s automatic dependency scanner does not know
	about preprocessor conditionals.  Thus if you do something like
	this:
<pre>
#ifdef VAR
#include "file1.h"
#else
#include "file2.h"
#endif
</pre>
	<p><i>makepp</i> will assume both <code>file1.h</code> and
	<code>file2.h</code> are dependencies.  This will usually not be
	a problem--it will just trigger rebuilds more often than
	necessary--unless one of the files doesn't exist.  In this case,
	<i>makepp</i> will give a warning message (but will still
	compile as usual).  If, however, you use the system include
	format, i.e.,
<pre>
#include &lt;xyz.h&gt;
</pre>
	instead of
<pre>
#include "xyz.h"
</pre>
	then <i>makepp</i> won't complain about a missing file because
	it assumes it's buried in some system include directory that it
	doesn't know about.</p>

      <li>
	<i>Makepp</i> does not like it if you create new soft links to
	existing directories during the course of the build.  It
	shouldn't get confused if you create new directories; just don't
	create new soft links to existing directories.

      <li>
	<i>Makepp</i> is slower than make.  This is mostly because it's
	doing a lot more work.  You can speed it up somewhat by <a
	href="command_line.html#option_nolog">turning off logging</a>,
	but because it is doing a lot more comparisons, it will always
	be slower.

      <li>
	<i>Makepp</i> can use a surprisingly large amount of memory.
	This is (a) because it's written in perl, and perl is a memory
	hog; (b) because of <i>makepp</i>'s algorithm, it simply has to
	store a lot more information about many more files than make
	does.  But if someone wants to pay to have the core of it
	rewritten in C++, then it could be somewhat faster and a lot
	smaller....
    </ul>
