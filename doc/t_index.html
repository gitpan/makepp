    <h1>Writing Makefiles</h1>

    <p>A <i>makefile</i> is the set of instructions that you use to tell
    <i>makepp</i> how to build your program.  <i>Makepp</i> can accept
    most makefiles written for the standard unix make, but if you're
    starting from scratch, it is often much simpler to use some of
    <i>makepp</i>'s advanced features.  This is an introduction for
    writing makefiles that are specific to <i>makepp</i>.</p>

    <p>If you already know a lot about writing makefiles, you might want
    to at least peruse the examples because they show the preferred way
    to do things with <i>makepp</i>, which is often different from the
    traditional way to do it with make.</p>
