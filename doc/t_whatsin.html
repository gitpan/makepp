    <h1>What is in a makefile</h1>

    <p>Building a program from its source files can be a complicated and
    time-consuming operation.  The commands are too long to be typed in
    manually every time.  However, a straightforward shell script is
    seldom used for compiling a program, because it's too time-consuming
    to recompile all modules when only one of them has changed.</p>

    <p>However, it's too error-prone to allow a human to tell the
    computer which files need to be recompiled.  Forgetting to recompile
    a file can mean hours of frustrating debugging.  A reliable
    automatic tool for determining exactly which modules need
    recompilation is necessary.</p>

    <p><i>Makepp</i> (short for Make-plus-plus, or <b>make++</b>) is a
    tool for solving exactly this problem.  It is an improvement on the
    <b>make</b> program, a standard tool that has been around for many
    years.  It reads a file called a <i>makefile</i> that contains the
    commands necessary for building output files from input files.</p>

    <p>Usually, the input files are program source code, and the output
    files are executables, but <i>makepp</i> doesn't care what they are.
    You can use a makefile to control any kind of procedure where you
    need to selectively execute certain commands depending on which
    files have changed.  You could, for example, use <i>makepp</i> to do
    data analysis, where your input files are raw data and analysis
    programs, and your output files are processed data or graphs or
    whatever.  <i>Makepp</i> will figure out which of the processed data
    files need to be updated whenever some of the data files or analysis
    programs change.  The examples in introduction will assume you are
    building an executable program from source code, but you can do a
    lot more with <i>makepp</i> than just that if you use your
    imagination.</p>

    <p>If your program consists of a single module, you really don't
    need a makefile, because you know that any change that you make
    requires recompiling that module.  However, if your program consists
    of even just two modules, then you will definitely want to use a
    program like <i>makepp</i>.</p>
