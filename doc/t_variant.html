    <h1>Source/Object Separation and Variant Builds</h1>

    <p>Up to this point all of the makefiles we have seen put the object
    files in the same directory as the source files.  This is usually
    the way makefiles are written, and it's certainly the simplest way
    to do things.  However, suppose you have to compile your program on
    both a linux machine and a Solaris machine.  The binaries from the
    two machines are incompatible, of course.  Unlike the traditional
    make, <i>makepp</i> is smart enough to know that if the last
    compilation was on linux, and the current compilation is on Solaris,
    a recompilation of everything is necessary.</p>

    <p>But this still leaves a problem: when you recompile on Solaris,
    you wipe out your linux binaries.  Then when you switch back to
    linux, you have to recompile everything again, even though the
    source files that haven't changed.</p>

    <p>A related problem is if you build your program with several
      different options.  Suppose for example that you usually compile
      your program with optimization:</p>
<pre>
CFLAGS	:= -O2

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)

my_program: *.o
	$(CC) $(inputs) -o $(output)
</pre>

    <p>However, you discover a bug, and you want to enable debugging on
    all files, so you do change <code>CFLAGS</code>:
<pre>
CFLAGS	:= -g -DMALLOC_DEBUG
</pre>

    <p><i>Makepp</i> realizes that the build commands have changed, and
    it needs to recompile everything.  But again, recompiling with
    debugging enabled wipes out your old binaries, so if you want to
    turn optimization back on, everything must be recompiled again, even
    the files that haven't changed.</p>

    <p>The obvious solution to these problems is to put the
    architecture-dependent or build-variant-dependent files in a
    separate subdirectory.  There are two basic techniques for doing
    this: explicitly specifying an alternate directory, or using
      repositories.</p>

    <h2>Explicit specifications of alternate directories</h2>

    <p>You could rewrite the rules in your makefile to dump the objects
      into a different directory, like this:</p>

<pre>
ARCH	:= $(shell uname -m)	# ARCH becomes the output from the uname -m command.
CFLAGS	:= -O2
OBJDIR	:= $(ARCH)-optim

$(OBJDIR)/%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)

$(OBJDIR)/my_program: $(OBJDIR)/*.o
	$(CC) $(inputs) -o $(output)
</pre>

    <p>Now when you run <i>makepp</i>, <code>ARCH</code> is
      automatically set to something different for each architecture,
      and all of the objects are placed in a different directory for
      each architecture, so they don't overwrite each other.  If you
      want to recompile turning on debugging, then you would have to
      change both <code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>OBJDIR</code>.</p>

    <p>One problem with this approach is that <a
    href="t_dirs.html">implicit loading of makefiles</a> will no longer
    work.  The only place that <i>makepp</i> knows to look for a
    makefile when it needs to build something is in the directory of the
    file it's trying to build.  If this is a problem for you, then you
    can explicitly tell <i>makepp</i> where to look using the <a
    href="syntax_makefile.html#load_makefile_statement"><code>load_makefile</code></a>
    statement.</p>


    <h2>Repositories</h2>

    <p>Repositories are a magical way of using a makefile that is
    written to put objects in the same directory, but having
    <i>makepp</i> automatically put the objects in a different
    directory.  Suppose we start with the original makefile above
    (before we modified it to put the objects in a different directory),
    and we've been working on linux so our source directory is filled
    with linux binaries.  When we want to recompile our code on solaris
    instead of linux, we use the following command instead of just
    typing <code>makepp</code>:</p>

<pre>
% mkdir solaris
% cd solaris
% makepp -R ..
</pre>

    <p>What the <code>-R</code> option to <i>makepp</i> does in this
    case is to declare the directory <code>..</code> (which is the
    original source directory) as a repository.  A repository is just a
    way of getting <i>makepp</i> to trick all of the actions into
    believing that all files in one directory tree are actually located
    in a different directory tree in the file system.  In the above
    example, <i>makepp</i> pretends that all the files in
    <code>..</code> (and all subdirectories of <code>..</code>) are
    actually in the current directory (and corresponding
    subdirectories).</p>

    <p>More precisely, a repository is a place where <i>makepp</i> looks
    if it needs to find a file that doesn't exist in the current
    directory tree.  If the file exists in the current directory tree,
    it is used; if it doesn't exist, but a file exists in the
    repository, <i>makepp</i> makes a temporary symbolic link from the
    file in the repository to the current directory.  (A symbolic link
    is an alias for the original file.  It's like a copy, except that
    trying to access the link actually accesses the original file.)  The
    rule actions then act on the file in the current directory, but
    actually reference the files in the repository.</p>

    <p>In this example, initially we start off with a blank new
    directory <code>solaris</code>.  (It doesn't have to be blank, of
    course, and it won't be the second time you run <i>makepp</i>.)
    <i>Makepp</i> is run in this directory, and it sees that there is no
    makefile there.  However, there is a makefile in the repository, so
    it links in the one from the repository, and reads it.  The pattern
    rule in the makefile that converts <code>.c</code> files into
    <code>.o</code> files causes <i>makepp</i> to link all the
    <code>.c</code> files that it needs from the repository, and run the
    compilation command from the <code>solaris</code> subdirectory.
    Therefore the <code>.o</code> files are now placed into the
    <code>solaris</code> subdirectory, not in the top level directory.
    When the build command is finished, any files linked from the
    repository are deleted, so the <code>solaris</code> subdirectory
    will contain only the binary files for Solaris.  Any <code>.o</code>
    files that exist in the repository are unmodified, so when you go
    back to your linux machine and rerun <i>makepp</i>, most of your
    program will not have to be recompiled.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it might be more convenient to use a different form of
    the repository command.  The above three shell commands could be
    entirely replaced by the following one command:</p>

<pre>
% makepp -R solaris=. -F solaris
</pre>
    <p>What this does is to say that the files in the current directory
    are to be linked into the <code>solaris</code> subdirectory as
    necessary.  (The <code>solaris</code> subdirectory will be created
    automatically if it does not exist.)  Then the <code>-F</code>
    option causes <i>makepp</i> to cd to the solaris directory and
    execute the makefile there (which will be linked from the
    repository).</p>

    <p>Using a repository does not have the same drawbacks as explicitly
    specifying an object directory; makefiles will be implicitly loaded
    as expected, since as far as <i>makepp</i> is concerned, the
    makefile actually is in the same directory as the target files.
    However, if your build involves not just one but several directory
    trees, using repositories can become quite complicated.</p>

    <p>Repositories are just a way of pretending that things located at
    one place in the file system are actually in a different place for
    the duration of the build.  This is a very powerful technique that
    can be used for more than just separating your sources and binaries.
