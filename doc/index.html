    <h1>Makepp manual</h1>

    <p><i>Makepp</i> is a drop-in replacement for GNU make which has a
    number of features that allow for more reliable builds and simpler
    build files.  It supports almost all of the syntax that GNU make
    supports, and can be used with makefiles produced by utilities such
    as automake.  It is called <i>makepp</i> (or <b>make++</b>) because
    (1) it was designed for building C++ programs; (2) its relationship
    to <b>make</b> is analogous to C++'s relationship to C.  For
    backward compatibility, it will work with input files designed for
    <b>make</b>, but there are much better ways to do things.</p>

    <p><i>Makepp</i> currently runs only on unix, because I do not
    develop on Windows at the moment.  It could be ported, but this has
    not happened yet.</p>
