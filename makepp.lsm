Title: makepp
Version: 1.18
Entered-date: 2002-01-09
Description: A syntax-compatible replacement for GNU make with numerous
   enhancements for build reliability.  Remembers last build command and
   rebuilds if build command or any file changed.  Vastly improved
   system for handling makefiles from different directories.
   Automatically scans for include files.  Won't rebuild if only
   comments or whitespace changed.  Wildcards match not only files which
   exist, but also those which can be built.  Can automatically separate
   source and object directories and keep variant builds in different
   directories, all without modifying makefiles.  User can write
   arbitrary perl functions for particularly complicated textual
   transformations.
Keywords: make, build, compile, variant build
