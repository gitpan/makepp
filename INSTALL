Prerequistes for installation:
  You must have perl 5.6 or newer somewhere on your system.

Installation instructions:

If you want to test makepp out, you can run makepp without installing
it.  To run the test suite, cd to the makepp directory and type "make
test".  If you want to run makepp on your own makefiles, either put the
directory you unpacked it in your path, or else run it explicitly like
this:

	perl /where/you/unpacked/it/makepp

If you want to install it, then cd to the directory you unpacked the
distribution into and type:

	perl install.pl

This will ask you where you want to put the various pieces, and will then
install them as requested.

Or you can also do:

        configure --prefix=/usr/local
	make install

which will run the regression tests as well.
