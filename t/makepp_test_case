# Simple shell script to create a ".test" test case for makepp using spar.
# The first argument is the name of a directory containing the test case.
#
# This script will automatically remove the makepp database and logs. In
# order to ensure that the ".test" file does not depend on whether the
# test case was already run, the makepp "clean" target and/or the
# "cleanup_script" executable should ensure that all other generated files
# are removed.
#
# "spar" must be in the path, or the SPAR environment variable must point
# to it. "spar" is in the makepp CVS tree under t.
